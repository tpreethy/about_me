	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>I am a Front End and iOS developer who loves good design, good coffee, and good people. I work as a Front-End Development and iOS mentor for Thinkful, a web developer for IdeaBase, and a freelance iOS developer.</p>
	<p>I love the web and all the awesome things that come out of it. I’m excited to live and work in a time of huge advances in web technology. It’s easier than ever to share and collaborate with others, all because of the Internet.</p>
	<p>Education is also super important to me - I come from a family of educators - and I’m stoked to work with Thinkful’s awesome student community.</p>
